        <p class="lead text-justify leadha">Profoundly inspired by its spiritual and religious roots, the ocean, natural environment, and volcanic ancestry, Hawaii is a philosophical epicenter for blending the power of the elements with the essence of Humanity.</p> 
        <p class="lead text-justify leadha">The energy of these islands is really powerful, it's almost like if you could hear the drums beating inside of your chest and the polynesic magic finds a home in your soul. Hawaii makes you feel like if you've lived there your entire life.  It's love at first sight. Aloha is the unconditional desire to promote the true good of other people in a friendly spirit out of a sense of kindship.</p>
        <p class="lead text-justify leadha">Trade winds behind you, rainbows above you, Aloha all around you. Once you've come to Hawaii, you wll never be the same. You may physically leave Hawaii, but Hawaii will always live in your soul after your visit. That is of course, if you ever manage to leave these beautiful islands.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text">A few quick facts about Hawaii that will give you a first idea of what to expect and what to plan for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Language: English. Japanese available in most touristic spots. Of course, Hawaiian words are broadly used and mixed with English.</li>
            <li>Budget: High, most activities cost around 100 USD</li>
            <li>Weather: Tropical. Hot all year around. Don't forget to bring sunscreen and mosquito repellent</li>
            <li>Length of stay: If you have the budget, stay at least 4 weeks</li>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Share the Aloha. <span class="text-muted">Breath of life.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead text-justify">Nature is where it all begins for the Hawaiians. They are the children of the land, born from the union of Earth mother and sky father. Be mindful of their culture by respecting the nature. Don't use plastic. If you do, you will be charged an environmental fee. Use only reef-safe sunscreen as the strong chemicals of other sunscreens kill the reef.</p>
        <p class="lead text-justify"> Also, be aware of ocean safety. You maybe a fine swimmer and even known to the Pacific Ocean, however the power of the Hawaiians waves are a completely different story. Pay attention to the signs on the beach about the current conditions and when in doubt, don't go in. This applies to swimming, surfing, snorkeling, sailing and all other ocean activities.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Must-do Activities</h2>
        <p class="lead">There are so many things you can do while in Hawaii, there is something for every kind of traveler. Here are some of my best ranked recommendations:</p>

        <details>
          <summary>Surf</summary>
            <p class="actvs">Surfing is part of the Hawaiian culture and there are plenty of options for everyone. There are big waves for pro, baby waves for beginners, and everything in between. Be aware, even if you have some experience surfing, never go on your own, always go where you can find locals around.</p>
            <p class="actvs">You can take a single lesson in most places, but you can also book a surf camp for several days and they include accomodation and most times also meals. This latter option is highly recommended for solo travelers.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Hiking</summary>
            <p class="actvs">Everywhere you look around seems like the movies, go exploring!. Pay attention that most hikes, even the ones you see around on social media, are ilegal in Hawaii. This means that if you break your ankle you can't sue the state (sadly that's a common practice in the US). If you choose to go hiking to one of these ilegal places, be prepared to pay a fine if you are caught</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Scuba Dive</summary>
            <p class="actvs">Wether you have a PADI licence or not, you have a diving option in Hawaii. You could do a Discovery diving for first timers or beginners, or you can get licenced! Many diving schools offer PADI courses.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Ocean activities</summary>
            <p class="actvs">Swimming with sharks or manta rays, or maybe snorkeling with the turtles. How about whale or dolphin watching? You cn do all of these in Hawaii. If you don't want to get wet, no worries! you can take the submarine and explore the bottom of the ocean, or just remain on the surface for a cruise dinner.</p>
        </details>
        <details >
          <summary>Visit the volcanoes</summary>
            <p class="actvs">There is currently no lava on the Hawaiian Islands but you can still see the devastation trail and how the rock has melted over the years. You should definitely pay a visit to Volcano on the Big Island.</p>
        </details>
        <details >
          <summary>Air adventures</summary>
            <p class="actvs">Try a helicopter ride, best to do it in Kauai for the scenic views. Try the no door ones.And if you're feeling more adventurous than that, how about sky diving?</p>
