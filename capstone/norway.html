        <p class="lead leadha text-justify">A landscape that is both rugged and fragile. A cosy place to recharge and appreciate the slow life and enjoy the silence. Welcome to Northern Norway, where nature will surprise you and the culture will amaze you. If you visit in Winter you get a whole different experience than in any other time of the year: you get to see the very genesis of the word winter. The cold breeze will bring new life to your bones and in the deep silence you will hear nature speaking to you. There is something magical about the polar night. The intense contrast with the darkness will make the snow glow in front of your eyes. The only light the sun will present you with is one of the most beautuful sun experiences: a sunrise that never makes it above the horizon but instead it fuses into a very long sunset, letting you with a 4 hours twightlight. And suddenly and completely unexpected in the middle of the black starry sky, even though you are most likely chasing for them, they decide to materialize in front of you: the northern lights dancing in the sky. A breathtaking experience that will make your heart skip a beat.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Darkness like you've never seen before. <span class="text-muted">Glowing skylights.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead text-justify">Tromsø, the largest city in Norther Norway, is the most visited destination above the Nowegian arctic circle. However, if you are looking for a real sense of the arctic life, pay a visit to the smaller villages around the fjords. Alta, a town stretching along the inner part of the fjord with a sheltered subarctic climate, is a very good choice. The frequent clear skies are the reason why Alta early was chosen as an excellent location for studying the aurora borealis. The sun never sets during 3 months in summer: "midnight sun", while it never sets during 3 months in winter in the so-called polar night.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Must-do Activities</h2>
        <p class="lead">Northern Norway is a region that will delight your senses with many possibilities to choose from. Here are some of the best alternatives to make the best of your arctic experience:</p>

        <details>
          <summary>Northern Lights</summary>
            <p class="actvs">It's not easy to see them. You should allow a few nights to try to chase them. If you are lucky you will see them more than once but you may well not get to see them. So plan well and check the northern light forcast before deciding on a date. And be patient, you may need to wait in the cold for long but it's absoloutely worth it.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Husky Sledding</summary>
            <p class="actvs">Dog sledding is an actual sport in the north and dogs are trained as professional athletes. Go to one of these training places and be with the dogs before/after your ride and try to connect with them. In spite of their training they are very playful and love the attention. While driving the sled, be aware it can get really fast and if you don't drive carefully you may fall.</p>
            <p class="actvs">If you are more adventurous and have the time, try an expedition of several days crossing the arctic on a dog sled.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Reindeer Sledding</summary>
            <p class="actvs">This a complete different experience than with dogs. Reindeers are slow so the ride will be easy and calm. You will enjoy the glowing snow on the way join by a local sami to help you with the reindeer. An also, if you're lucky some northern lights will put up a show.</p>
            <p class="actvs">Samis don't name the reindeers, so they don't get attached. The sooner than later they will be cooked. Reindeer stew is a speciality in the arctic. You may try it maybe on the same day a reindeer gave you a ride.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Fat Biking</summary>
            <p class="actvs">Biking on snow it's not easy, but there are tracks normally used by dog sleds that you can bike on. It's a very good way to explore around, but dress well cause even though you will produce a lot of heat from intense exercise, it's still very cold in the air.</p>
        </details>
        <details >
          <summary>Ice Fishing</summary>
            <p class="actvs">Sitting on a frozen lake, warmth with reindeer fur is a very good way to connect with the nature in the arctic. You may catch or not, but the whole experience is just amazing.</p>
        </details>
        <details >
          <summary>Ice Hotel</summary>
            <p class="actvs">You think an ice castle is something only exist in Disney movies? Well, there are hotels up north that are built every winter with a different theme. You can even book your wedding there. You can choose the whole experience of sleeping there, or just go around and feel like in a fairy tail...and pay a visit to the bar and get your vodka on a glass made of ice!</p>
        </details>
         <details >
          <summary>Snow Safari</summary>
            <p class="actvs">If you like adrenaline, jump on a snow mobile and speed up through the arctic! There are guided tours that will show you where to go.</p>
